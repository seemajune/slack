mongo:

$ show dbs

to delete the entire db, quit app & type command:

TO DO:
note: The accounts-ui package provides the login form, as well as calling methods to register/login our users. But for production applications, you might want to create your own UI and set your own account management logic
For example, youâ€™d manually call Accounts.createUser() to create the user, and customize the creation logic with Accounts.onCreateUser() - see: http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/accounts_api  && http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/accounts_passwords

note: oauth- need to add accounts-google, accounts-facebook, accounts-twitter for easy sign up

modify default email template w/ Accounts.emailTemplates

note: Template.registerHelper() function to define a helper function which can be used from all templates.
